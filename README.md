This repository contains the apps made during the duration of practice school 1 
CalCount: Developed an android app where the user can take an image of a food item and receive detailed nutritional information about the same (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, calories, etc). The app currently recognizes 8 food items and uses the TensorFlow lite API. 
Medic Reminder â€“ Developed an everyday medication reminder android app. Users can add reminders and their device would notify them of the same at the appropriate time and repetition interval. It also kept track of the monthly stock of medicines left. This app was done as a part of the Practice school 1 internship at Tamil Nadu Health System Reforms.
